## 1. First probabilistic radiological risk appraisal of Bay of Bengal beach sands: Explicit spatial hot-spot analysis

**Authors**: Jahanara Habib Zesha, **Md. Abdullah-Al Mamun**, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul Islam, Md. Ahosan Habib, Rahat Khan

### Abstract

<div align="justify">
This study presents the first integrated probabilistic–spatial framework for assessing radiological risk in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) beach sands. Twenty-two surface sediment samples from Darianagar, Himchari, and Nidania beaches were analyzed using HPGe gamma spectrometry. Activity concentrations of <sup>226</sup>Ra and <sup>232</sup>Th exceeded global averages by factors of 2.2 and 4.1. PCA identified natural mineralogical controls. Monte Carlo simulations showed radiological indices exceeding international safety thresholds by 8–23×. Radionuclides followed lognormal distributions. Sensitivity analysis indicated <sup>232</sup>Th (~75%) and <sup>226</sup>Ra (~24%) as dominant contributors to total radiological risk. GIS-based spatial mapping revealed localized hotspots requiring restricted access, signage, and monitoring. This framework supports improved coastal radiation surveillance and evidence-based regulation.

## 2. Tracing source footprints of heavy metal(oid)s in coastal soils using traditional statistical techniques and machine learning data-driven models

**Authors**: Abu Reza Md Towfiqul Islam, Memet Varol, Javed Mallick, **Md. Abdullah-Al Mamun**, Md. Yousuf Mia, Md. Abu Bakar Siddique, Md Saiful Islam, Mst. Nazneen Aktar

### Abstract

<div align="justify">
Understanding the source tracing of heavy metal(oid)s (HMs) in coastal soils is essential for effective pollution control. This study used traditional statistical techniques (PCA, PCoA) together with machine-learning models, including Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), Conditional Inference Trees (CIT), Ridge Regression (RR), and SHAP, to detect and trace HM sources along the northeast coast of Bangladesh. Concentrations of Pb, Cd, Mn, and As exceeded average shale values. Clear spatial patterns were observed, with PCoA explaining 75.46% of the total spatial variation. SOM indicated natural sources for As, Ni, Fe, and Mn, and shipbreaking industry sources for Cu, Zn, and Pb. CIT showed the influence of soil silt on Fe, Cd, and As, and the impact of soil pH on Mn and Ni, suggesting geological controls. RR modeling showed high predictive performance for Pb, Zn, and Mn, while SHAP highlighted soil pH, silt, and organic matter as key contributors to HM accumulation. This integrated approach provides a strong foundation for controlling HM contamination in coastal regions.

### ✨ Key Highlights

* PCoA explained **75.46%** of total spatial variation.
* Geological processes based on CIT controlled Mn and Ni levels.
* SOM indicated Cu, Zn, and Pb were linked to shipbreaking activity.
* Soil pH, silt, and organic matter contributed to HM accumulation.
* Ridge Regression showed high predictive performance for Pb, Zn, and Mn.

## 3.  Optimizing coastal groundwater quality predictions: A novel data mining framework with cross-validation, bootstrapping, and entropy analysis

### Abstract

<div align="justify">
Investigating the potential of novel data mining algorithms (DMAs) for modeling groundwater quality in coastal areas is an important requirement for groundwater resource management, especially in the coastal region of Bangladesh where groundwater is highly contaminated. In this work, the applicability of DMAs, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), for predicting groundwater quality in coastal areas was investigated. The optuna-based optimized hyperparameter is proposed to improve the accuracy of the models, including optuna-GPR and optuna-BRR as benchmark models. Combined cross-validation (CV) and bootstrapping (B) methods were used to build six predictive models. The entropy-based coastal groundwater quality index (ECWQI) was converted into a normalized index (ECWQIn), which was divided into five classes from very poor to excellent. The self-organizing map (SOM), spatial autocorrelation and fuzzy logic model were used to identify spatial groundwater quality patterns based on 12 physicochemical variables collected from 67 groundwater wells. The SOM analysis identified four distinct spatial patterns, including EC-TDS-Cl<sup>−</sup>, Mg-pH, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>-Na<sup>+</sup>-F<sup>−</sup>. The results showed that both the ANN (CV) and ANN (B) models performed better than other optuna-based models during the test phase (RMSE = 0.041, MAE = 0.026, R² = 0.971, RAE = 0.152 and CC = 0.986) and (RMSE = 0.041, MAE = 0.025, R² = 0.969, RAE = 0.119 and CC = 0.975), respectively. SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup> and F<sup>−</sup> played an important role in the prediction accuracy. F<sup>−</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> showed higher spatial autocorrelation, which affected groundwater quality degradation. In addition, the ANN (CV) and ANN (B) models showed a Gaussian distribution of model errors (small standard error, <1%), indicating the stability of the model. These results indicate the efficiency of the ANN model in predicting groundwater quality in coastal areas, which would help regional water managers in real-time monitoring and management of sustainable groundwater resources.
</div>

### ✨ Key Highlights

* The models ANN (CV) and ANN (B) outperformed other data mining approaches.
* The normalized ECWQI was adopted to interpret coastal groundwater quality areas.
* SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, and F<sup>−</sup> had a significant role in predictive accuracy.
* The Moran's I index for F<sup>−</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> demonstrates strong spatial autocorrelation and implies clustering of similar origins.

## 4. Predicting groundwater phosphate levels in coastal multi-aquifers: A geostatistical and data-driven approach

### Abstract

<div align="justify">
The groundwater (GW) resource plays a central role in securing water supply in the coastal region of Bangladesh and therefore the future sustainability of this valuable resource is crucial for the area. However, there is limited research on the driving factors and prediction of phosphate concentration in groundwater. In this work, geostatistical modeling, self-organizing maps (SOM) and data-driven algorithms were combined to determine the driving factors and predict GW phosphate content in coastal multi-aquifers in southern Bangladesh. The SOM analysis identified three distinct spatial patterns: K<sup>+</sup>–Na<sup>+</sup>–pH, Ca<sup>2+</sup>–Mg<sup>2+</sup>–NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>–SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>–F<sup>−</sup>. Four data-driven algorithms, including CatBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to predict phosphate concentration in GW using 380 samples and 15 prediction parameters. Forecasting accuracy was evaluated using RMSE, R², RAE, CC, and MAE. Phosphate dissolution and saltwater intrusion, along with phosphorus fertilizers, increase PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> content in GW. Using input parameters selected by multicollinearity and SOM, the CatBoost model showed exceptional performance in both training (RMSE = 0.002, MAE = 0.001, R² = 0.999, RAE = 0.057, CC = 1.00) and testing (RMSE = 0.001, MAE = 0.002, R² = 0.989, RAE = 0.057, CC = 0.998). Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> significantly influenced prediction accuracy. The uncertainty study revealed a low standard error for the CatBoost model, indicating robustness and consistency. Semi-variogram models confirmed that the most influential attributes showed weak dependence, suggesting that agricultural runoff increases the heterogeneity of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> distribution in GW. These findings are crucial for developing conservation and strategic plans for sustainable utilization of coastal GW resources.

### ✨ Key Highlights

* A dataset of 15 hydrochemical parameters from 380 wells was presented.
* SOM and multicollinearity testing enhanced ML model performance in coastal aquifers.
* CatBoost combined with geostatistics and SOM predicted PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> with high accuracy (R² = 0.99).
* Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> showed high spatial autocorrelation, impacting PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> prediction.
