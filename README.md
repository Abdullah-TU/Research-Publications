### Abstract
The groundwater (GW) resource plays a central role in securing water supply in the coastal region of Bangladesh and therefore the future sustainability of this valuable resource is crucial for the area. However, there is limited research on the driving factors and prediction of phosphate concentration in groundwater. In this work, geostatistical modeling, self-organizing maps (SOM) and data-driven algorithms were combined to determine the driving factors and predict GW phosphate content in coastal multi-aquifers in southern Bangladesh. The SOM analysis identified three distinct spatial patterns: K+single bondNa+single bondpH, Ca2+single bondMg2+single bondNO₃−, and HCO₃−single bondSO₄2−single bondPO43−single bondF−. Four data-driven algorithms, including CatBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to predict phosphate concentration in GW using 380 samples and 15 prediction parameters. Forecasting accuracy was evaluated using RMSE, R2, RAE, CC, and MAE. Phosphate dissolution and saltwater intrusion, along with phosphorus fertilizers, increase PO43− content in GW. Using input parameters selected by multicollinearity and SOM, the CatBoost model showed exceptional performance in both training (RMSE = 0.002, MAE = 0.001, R2 = 0.999, RAE = 0.057, CC = 1.00) and testing (RMSE = 0.001, MAE = 0.002, R2 = 0.989, RAE = 0.057, CC = 0.998). Na+, K+, and Mg2+ significantly influenced prediction accuracy. The uncertainty study revealed a low standard error for the CatBoost model, indicating robustness and consistency. Semi-variogram models confirmed that the most influential attributes showed weak dependence, suggesting that agricultural runoff increases the heterogeneity of PO43− distribution in GW. These findings are crucial for developing conservation and strategic plans for sustainable utilization of coastal GW resources.

### Key Highlights:
- **Dataset**: 380 samples collected from 15 hydrochemical parameters.
- **Techniques**: Geostatistics, SOM, and machine learning models.

### Abstract

[cite\_start]Investigating the potential of novel data mining algorithms (DMAs) for modeling groundwater quality in coastal areas is an important requirement for groundwater resource management, especially in the coastal region of Bangladesh where groundwater is highly contaminated[cite: 30]. [cite\_start]In this work, the applicability of DMA, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), for predicting groundwater quality in coastal areas was investigated[cite: 31]. [cite\_start]The optuna-based optimized hyperparameter is proposed to improve the accuracy of the models, including optuna-GPR and optuna-BRR as benchmark models[cite: 32]. [cite\_start]Combined cross-validation (CV) and bootstrapping (B) methods were used to build six predictive models[cite: 33]. [cite\_start]The entropy-based coastal groundwater quality index (ECWQI) was converted into a normalized index (ECWQIn), which was divided into five classes from very poor to excellent[cite: 34]. [cite\_start]The self-organizing map (SOM), spatial autocorrelation and fuzzy logic model were used to identify spatial groundwater quality patterns based on 12 physicochemical variables collected from 67 groundwater wells[cite: 35]. [cite\_start]The results showed that both the ANN (CV) and ANN (B) models performed better than other optuna-based models during the test phase ($RMSE=0.041$, $MAE=0.026$, $R^2=0.971$, and $CC=0.986$) and ($RMSE=0.041$, $MAE=0.025$, $R^2=0.969$, and $CC=0.975$), respectively[cite: 36]. [cite\_start]$SO_{4}^{2-}$, Cl⁻ and F⁻ played an important role in the prediction accuracy[cite: 37]. [cite\_start]These results indicate the efficiency of the ANN model in predicting groundwater quality in coastal areas, which would help regional water managers in real-time monitoring and management of sustainable groundwater resources[cite: 40].

### Abstract

We integrate traditional statistics (PCA, PCoA) with machine-learning tools (Self-Organizing Maps, Conditional Inference Trees, Ridge Regression, SHAP) to trace sources of heavy metal(oid)s (As, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Cr, Mn, Fe, U) in coastal soils along the northeast Bay of Bengal. Several metals (Pb, Cd, Mn, As) exceed average shale values, with clear spatial patterns separating industrial/shipbreaking hotspots from geogenic backgrounds. Ridge models achieve high predictive accuracy and SHAP explains the controlling roles of soil pH, texture (sand/silt/clay), elevation, and organic matter. Findings support targeted pollution control and sustainable coastal management. 

### ✨ Key Highlights

* **📍 Study area & scope**: Northeast coast of Bangladesh; spatial source-tracing of heavy metal(oid)s in coastal soils. 
* **🧪 Methods**: PCA, PCoA, SOM, CIT, Ridge Regression (Bayesian-optimized), SHAP, and GIS mapping (IDW). 
* **⚠️ Exceedances**: Pb, Cd, Mn, and As exceed average shale/background values in parts of the study region. 
* **🔄 Source signals**: SOM & CIT indicate **shipbreaking/industrial** signatures (Cu, Zn, Pb) vs **geogenic** controls (As, Ni, Cr, Mn, Fe). 
* **📈 Model performance**: Ridge shows very strong fits—e.g., **Ni R² ≈ 0.998**, **Fe R² ≈ 0.995**, **Cd R² ≈ 0.977**, **Mn R² ≈ 0.898**—aligning with CIT/SHAP drivers. 
* **🗺️ Spatial structure**: PCoA explains **~75.46%** of spatial variation; industrial hotspots (e.g., Patenga/Sonadia/Kutubdia) contrast with lower-impact islands (e.g., St. Martin’s). 

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

* **Sampling**: **78** surface-soil samples (0–10 cm) from **6 sites** — St. Martin’s, Matarbari, Kutubdia, Sonadia, Sandwip, Patenga — collected **March–April 2023**. 
* **Analytes**: As, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Cr, Mn, Fe, U (AAS; QA/QC with reference materials; recoveries ~95–110%).

## 📊 Results

* **Source tracing**: SOM clusters and CIT thresholds separate **anthropogenic** (shipbreaking, battery/industrial waste, fertilizer runoff) from **geogenic** patterns. 
* **Explained variation**: PCoA axis pair explains **75.46%** of spatial differences in metal profiles. 
* **Model + XAI**: Ridge predictions align with SHAP—**pH**, **texture (silt/clay)**, **OM**, **elevation** are dominant drivers; metals show site-specific hotspots consistent with industry/agriculture.
