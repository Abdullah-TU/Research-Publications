### Abstract
<div align="justify">
The groundwater (GW) resource plays a central role in securing water supply in the coastal region of Bangladesh and therefore the future sustainability of this valuable resource is crucial for the area. However, there is limited research on the driving factors and prediction of phosphate concentration in groundwater. In this work, geostatistical modeling, self-organizing maps (SOM) and data-driven algorithms were combined to determine the driving factors and predict GW phosphate content in coastal multi-aquifers in southern Bangladesh. The SOM analysis identified three distinct spatial patterns: K<sup>+</sup>–Na<sup>+</sup>–pH, Ca<sup>2+</sup>–Mg<sup>2+</sup>–NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>–SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>–F<sup>−</sup>. Four data-driven algorithms, including CatBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to predict phosphate concentration in GW using 380 samples and 15 prediction parameters. Forecasting accuracy was evaluated using RMSE, R², RAE, CC, and MAE. Phosphate dissolution and saltwater intrusion, along with phosphorus fertilizers, increase PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> content in GW. Using input parameters selected by multicollinearity and SOM, the CatBoost model showed exceptional performance in both training (RMSE = 0.002, MAE = 0.001, R² = 0.999, RAE = 0.057, CC = 1.00) and testing (RMSE = 0.001, MAE = 0.002, R² = 0.989, RAE = 0.057, CC = 0.998). Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> significantly influenced prediction accuracy. The uncertainty study revealed a low standard error for the CatBoost model, indicating robustness and consistency. Semi-variogram models confirmed that the most influential attributes showed weak dependence, suggesting that agricultural runoff increases the heterogeneity of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> distribution in GW. These findings are crucial for developing conservation and strategic plans for sustainable utilization of coastal GW resources.

## 2.  Optimizing coastal groundwater quality predictions: A novel data mining framework with cross-validation, bootstrapping, and entropy analysis

### Abstract
<div align="justify">
Investigating the potential of novel data mining algorithms (DMAs) for modeling groundwater quality in coastal areas is an important requirement for groundwater resource management, especially in the coastal region of Bangladesh where groundwater is highly contaminated. In this work, the applicability of DMAs, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), for predicting groundwater quality in coastal areas was investigated. The optuna-based optimized hyperparameter is proposed to improve the accuracy of the models, including optuna-GPR and optuna-BRR as benchmark models. Combined cross-validation (CV) and bootstrapping (B) methods were used to build six predictive models. The entropy-based coastal groundwater quality index (ECWQI) was converted into a normalized index (ECWQIn), which was divided into five classes from very poor to excellent. The self-organizing map (SOM), spatial autocorrelation and fuzzy logic model were used to identify spatial groundwater quality patterns based on 12 physicochemical variables collected from 67 groundwater wells. The SOM analysis identified four distinct spatial patterns, including EC-TDS-Cl<sup>−</sup>, Mg-pH, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>-Na<sup>+</sup>-F<sup>−</sup>. The results showed that both the ANN (CV) and ANN (B) models performed better than other optuna-based models during the test phase (RMSE = 0.041, MAE = 0.026, R² = 0.971, RAE = 0.152 and CC = 0.986) and (RMSE = 0.041, MAE = 0.025, R² = 0.969, RAE = 0.119 and CC = 0.975), respectively. SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup> and F<sup>−</sup> played an important role in the prediction accuracy. F<sup>−</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> showed higher spatial autocorrelation, which affected groundwater quality degradation. In addition, the ANN (CV) and ANN (B) models showed a Gaussian distribution of model errors (small standard error, <1%), indicating the stability of the model. These results indicate the efficiency of the ANN model in predicting groundwater quality in coastal areas, which would help regional water managers in real-time monitoring and management of sustainable groundwater resources.

### ✨ Key Highlights

* The models ANN (CV) and ANN (B) outperformed other data mining approaches.
* The normalized ECWQI was adopted to interpret coastal groundwater quality areas.
* SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, and F<sup>−</sup> had a significant role in predictive accuracy.
* The Moran's I index for F<sup>−</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> demonstrates strong spatial autocorrelation and implies clustering of similar origins.

## 3. Tracing source footprints of heavy metal(oid)s in coastal soils using traditional statistical techniques and machine learning data-driven models

**Authors**: Abu Reza Md Towfiqul Islam, Memet Varol, Javed Mallick, **Md. Abdullah-Al Mamun**, Md. Yousuf Mia, Md. Abu Bakar Siddique, **Md. Saiful Islam**, **Mst. Nazneen Aktar**

### Abstract

<div align="justify">
This study integrates traditional multivariate statistics (PCA, PCoA) with machine-learning approaches (Self-Organizing Maps, Conditional Inference Trees, Ridge Regression, SHAP) to trace source footprints of heavy metal(oid)s (As, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Cr, Mn, Fe, U) in coastal soils along the northeast Bay of Bengal. Several metals (Pb, Cd, Mn, As) exceed average shale/background values, with distinct spatial contrasts separating industrial/shipbreaking hotspots from geogenic zones. Ridge models achieved high predictive accuracy, and SHAP analysis identified soil pH, particle size distribution (sand–silt–clay), elevation, and organic matter as key drivers. Findings support improved pollution control and sustainable management in vulnerable coastal areas.
</div>

### ✨ Key Highlights

* A coastal dataset of 78 soil samples from six islands/peninsulas (St. Martin’s, Matarbari, Kutubdia, Sonadia, Sandwip, Patenga).
* Combined PCA, PCoA, SOM, CIT, Ridge Regression, SHAP, and GIS interpolation for source tracing.
* Pb, Cd, Mn, and As exceed average shale values in several industrial/shipbreaking-influenced locations.
* SOM and CIT distinguish anthropogenic signatures (Cu, Zn, Pb) from geogenic controls (As, Ni, Cr, Mn, Fe).
* Ridge models show strong performance (e.g., Ni R² ≈ 0.998; Fe R² ≈ 0.995; Cd R² ≈ 0.977; Mn R² ≈ 0.898).
* PCoA explains ~75.46% of spatial variation in heavy metal structure across the study region.
