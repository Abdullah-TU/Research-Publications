### Abstract

<div align="justify">
Coastal aquifers in southern Bangladesh are increasingly threatened by groundwater overexploitation, saltwater intrusion, and diffuse contamination, posing serious risks to safe water supply. While previous studies have largely focused on salinity and overall water quality degradation, the spatial dynamics and controlling factors of nitrate (NO₃⁻) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻) contamination remain poorly constrained. This study proposes a hybrid, data-driven, and interpretable modeling framework integrating machine learning, statistical analysis, and spatial assessment to predict nitrate and sulfate risks in coastal aquifers. The framework identifies dominant hydrogeochemical drivers, evaluates spatial contamination hotspots, and improves interpretability of prediction outcomes to support groundwater risk management and evidence-based decision-making in vulnerable coastal environments.
</div>

### ✨ Key Highlights

* Domestic wastewater and saltwater intrusion predominantly increased **SO₄²⁻** concentrations.
* Agro-fertilizer application and salinity were major contributors to **NO₃⁻** contamination.
* **CatBoost** showed optimal performance for sulfate prediction, while **ANN** performed best for nitrate.
* **Ca²⁺, Na⁺, and K⁺** were the primary drivers of elevated SO₄²⁻ and NO₃⁻ levels.
* Contamination hotspots were strongly influenced by **saltwater intrusion and agricultural practices**.

### Abstract

<div align="justify">
This study presents the first integrated probabilistic–spatial framework for assessing radiological risk in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) beach sands. Twenty-two surface sediment samples from Darianagar, Himchari, and Nidania beaches were analyzed using HPGe gamma spectrometry. Activity concentrations of <sup>226</sup>Ra and <sup>232</sup>Th exceeded global averages by factors of 2.2 and 4.1. PCA identified natural mineralogical controls. Monte Carlo simulations showed radiological indices exceeding international safety thresholds by 8–23×. Radionuclides followed lognormal distributions. Sensitivity analysis indicated <sup>232</sup>Th (~75%) and <sup>226</sup>Ra (~24%) as dominant contributors to total radiological risk. GIS-based spatial mapping revealed localized hotspots requiring restricted access, signage, and monitoring. This framework supports improved coastal radiation surveillance and evidence-based regulation.
</div>

### ✨ Key Highlights

* First integrated **PCA–GIS–Monte Carlo** risk assessment framework.
* <sup>226</sup>Ra and <sup>232</sup>Th exceeded global averages by **2.2×** and **4.1×**.
* PCA identified natural mineralogical controls as dominant radionuclide sources.
* Probabilistic indices exceeded international limits by **8–23×**.
* <sup>232</sup>Th (75%) and <sup>226</sup>Ra (24%) were the major contributors to radiological risk.

### Abstract
<div align="justify">
Understanding the source tracing of heavy metal(oid)s (HMs) in coastal soils is essential for effective pollution control. This study used traditional statistical techniques (PCA, PCoA) together with machine-learning models, including Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), Conditional Inference Trees (CIT), Ridge Regression (RR), and SHAP, to detect and trace HM sources along the northeast coast of Bangladesh. Concentrations of Pb, Cd, Mn, and As exceeded average shale values. Clear spatial patterns were observed, with PCoA explaining 75.46% of the total spatial variation. SOM indicated natural sources for As, Ni, Fe, and Mn, and shipbreaking industry sources for Cu, Zn, and Pb. CIT showed the influence of soil silt on Fe, Cd, and As, and the impact of soil pH on Mn and Ni, suggesting geological controls. RR modeling showed high predictive performance for Pb, Zn, and Mn, while SHAP highlighted soil pH, silt, and organic matter as key contributors to HM accumulation. This integrated approach provides a strong foundation for controlling HM contamination in coastal regions.

### ✨ Key Highlights

* PCoA explained **75.46%** of total spatial variation.
* Geological processes based on CIT controlled Mn and Ni levels.
* SOM indicated Cu, Zn, and Pb were linked to shipbreaking activity.
* Soil pH, silt, and organic matter contributed to HM accumulation.
* Ridge Regression showed high predictive performance for Pb, Zn, and Mn.

### Abstract

<div align="justify">
Investigating the potential of novel data mining algorithms (DMAs) for modeling groundwater quality in coastal areas is an important requirement for groundwater resource management, especially in the coastal region of Bangladesh where groundwater is highly contaminated. In this work, the applicability of DMAs, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), for predicting groundwater quality in coastal areas was investigated. The optuna-based optimized hyperparameter is proposed to improve the accuracy of the models, including optuna-GPR and optuna-BRR as benchmark models. Combined cross-validation (CV) and bootstrapping (B) methods were used to build six predictive models. The entropy-based coastal groundwater quality index (ECWQI) was converted into a normalized index (ECWQIn), which was divided into five classes from very poor to excellent. The self-organizing map (SOM), spatial autocorrelation and fuzzy logic model were used to identify spatial groundwater quality patterns based on 12 physicochemical variables collected from 67 groundwater wells. The SOM analysis identified four distinct spatial patterns, including EC-TDS-Cl<sup>−</sup>, Mg-pH, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>-Na<sup>+</sup>-F<sup>−</sup>. The results showed that both the ANN (CV) and ANN (B) models performed better than other optuna-based models during the test phase (RMSE = 0.041, MAE = 0.026, R² = 0.971, RAE = 0.152 and CC = 0.986) and (RMSE = 0.041, MAE = 0.025, R² = 0.969, RAE = 0.119 and CC = 0.975), respectively. SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup> and F<sup>−</sup> played an important role in the prediction accuracy. F<sup>−</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> showed higher spatial autocorrelation, which affected groundwater quality degradation. In addition, the ANN (CV) and ANN (B) models showed a Gaussian distribution of model errors (small standard error, <1%), indicating the stability of the model. These results indicate the efficiency of the ANN model in predicting groundwater quality in coastal areas, which would help regional water managers in real-time monitoring and management of sustainable groundwater resources.
</div>

  ### ✨ Key Highlights

* The models ANN (CV) and ANN (B) outperformed other data mining approaches.
* The normalized ECWQI was adopted to interpret coastal groundwater quality areas.
* SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, and F<sup>−</sup> had a significant role in predictive accuracy.
* The Moran's I index for F<sup>−</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> demonstrates strong spatial autocorrelation and implies clustering of similar origins.

### Abstract

<div align="justify">
The groundwater (GW) resource plays a central role in securing water supply in the coastal region of Bangladesh and therefore the future sustainability of this valuable resource is crucial for the area. However, there is limited research on the driving factors and prediction of phosphate concentration in groundwater. In this work, geostatistical modeling, self-organizing maps (SOM) and data-driven algorithms were combined to determine the driving factors and predict GW phosphate content in coastal multi-aquifers in southern Bangladesh. The SOM analysis identified three distinct spatial patterns: K<sup>+</sup>–Na<sup>+</sup>–pH, Ca<sup>2+</sup>–Mg<sup>2+</sup>–NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>–SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>–F<sup>−</sup>. Four data-driven algorithms, including CatBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to predict phosphate concentration in GW using 380 samples and 15 prediction parameters. Forecasting accuracy was evaluated using RMSE, R², RAE, CC, and MAE. Phosphate dissolution and saltwater intrusion, along with phosphorus fertilizers, increase PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> content in GW. Using input parameters selected by multicollinearity and SOM, the CatBoost model showed exceptional performance in both training (RMSE = 0.002, MAE = 0.001, R² = 0.999, RAE = 0.057, CC = 1.00) and testing (RMSE = 0.001, MAE = 0.002, R² = 0.989, RAE = 0.057, CC = 0.998). Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> significantly influenced prediction accuracy. The uncertainty study revealed a low standard error for the CatBoost model, indicating robustness and consistency. Semi-variogram models confirmed that the most influential attributes showed weak dependence, suggesting that agricultural runoff increases the heterogeneity of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> distribution in GW. These findings are crucial for developing conservation and strategic plans for sustainable utilization of coastal GW resources.
</div>

### ✨ Key Highlights

* A dataset of 15 hydrochemical parameters from 380 wells was presented.
* SOM and multicollinearity testing enhanced ML model performance in coastal aquifers.
* CatBoost combined with geostatistics and SOM predicted PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> with high accuracy (R² = 0.99).
* Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> showed high spatial autocorrelation, impacting PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> prediction.

## 6. Explainable and physics-informed machine learning for seasonal water quality prediction in the monsoon-driven Padma River Basin, Bangladesh

**Authors**: Abu Reza Md. Towfiqul Islam, **Md. Abdullah-Al Mamun**, Md. Nashir Uddin, Sheikh Fahim Faysal Sowrav, M. Nur E. Alam, Shahidur R. Khan, Mohaiminul Haider Chowdhury, Tasrina Rabia Choudhury

### Abstract

<div align="justify">
River water quality in monsoon-driven subtropical basins exhibits strong seasonal variability governed by hydroclimatic forcing and increasing anthropogenic pressure, complicating reliable assessment and management. This study presents the first integrated explainable and physics-informed artificial intelligence framework combining machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to predict, interpret, and spatially characterize seasonal water quality dynamics in the Padma River Basin, Bangladesh. Using 44 monitoring sites sampled during winter and monsoon seasons, the framework integrates Water Quality Index (WQI) assessment, explainable AI (SHAP and game-theory attribution), probabilistic uncertainty analysis, and spatial autocorrelation. Results show that seasonal variability dominates over spatial variability, with winter low-flow conditions intensifying solute concentrations and localized degradation, while monsoon discharge promotes basin-wide dilution and recovery. PINN-based data augmentation improves model generalization under limited sampling, and explainable modeling identifies nitrate, dissolved oxygen, pH, and suspended solids as key seasonal drivers. The proposed framework enhances predictive reliability, interpretability, and decision relevance, offering a transferable approach for uncertainty-aware water quality assessment in monsoon-affected, data-limited river basins.
</div>

### ✨ Key Highlights

* Seasonal variability dominated water quality dynamics (**p < 0.0001**).
* **DNN** performed best in winter (R² ≈ 0.98), while **Ridge Regression and Voting Ensemble** were more robust during monsoon.
* **NO₃⁻** emerged as the dominant contaminant, with episodic exceedance of WHO limits.
* **PINN-based data augmentation** improved prediction stability under limited sampling. 
* **SHAP and game-theory analysis** enabled transparent identification of season-specific pollution drivers.
* Spatial analysis revealed **localized winter degradation hotspots** and **widespread monsoon recovery**.
