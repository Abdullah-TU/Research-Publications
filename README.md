### Abstract
The groundwater (GW) resource plays a central role in securing water supply in the coastal region of Bangladesh and therefore the future sustainability of this valuable resource is crucial for the area. However, there is limited research on the driving factors and prediction of phosphate concentration in groundwater. In this work, geostatistical modeling, self-organizing maps (SOM) and data-driven algorithms were combined to determine the driving factors and predict GW phosphate content in coastal multi-aquifers in southern Bangladesh. The SOM analysis identified three distinct spatial patterns: K+single bondNa+single bondpH, Ca2+single bondMg2+single bondNO‚ÇÉ‚àí, and HCO‚ÇÉ‚àísingle bondSO‚ÇÑ2‚àísingle bondPO43‚àísingle bondF‚àí. Four data-driven algorithms, including CatBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to predict phosphate concentration in GW using 380 samples and 15 prediction parameters. Forecasting accuracy was evaluated using RMSE, R2, RAE, CC, and MAE. Phosphate dissolution and saltwater intrusion, along with phosphorus fertilizers, increase PO43‚àí content in GW. Using input parameters selected by multicollinearity and SOM, the CatBoost model showed exceptional performance in both training (RMSE = 0.002, MAE = 0.001, R2 = 0.999, RAE = 0.057, CC = 1.00) and testing (RMSE = 0.001, MAE = 0.002, R2 = 0.989, RAE = 0.057, CC = 0.998). Na+, K+, and Mg2+ significantly influenced prediction accuracy. The uncertainty study revealed a low standard error for the CatBoost model, indicating robustness and consistency. Semi-variogram models confirmed that the most influential attributes showed weak dependence, suggesting that agricultural runoff increases the heterogeneity of PO43‚àí distribution in GW. These findings are crucial for developing conservation and strategic plans for sustainable utilization of coastal GW resources.

### Abstract

[cite\_start]Investigating the potential of novel data mining algorithms (DMAs) for modeling groundwater quality in coastal areas is an important requirement for groundwater resource management, especially in the coastal region of Bangladesh where groundwater is highly contaminated[cite: 30]. [cite\_start]In this work, the applicability of DMA, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), for predicting groundwater quality in coastal areas was investigated[cite: 31]. [cite\_start]The optuna-based optimized hyperparameter is proposed to improve the accuracy of the models, including optuna-GPR and optuna-BRR as benchmark models[cite: 32]. [cite\_start]Combined cross-validation (CV) and bootstrapping (B) methods were used to build six predictive models[cite: 33]. [cite\_start]The entropy-based coastal groundwater quality index (ECWQI) was converted into a normalized index (ECWQIn), which was divided into five classes from very poor to excellent[cite: 34]. [cite\_start]The self-organizing map (SOM), spatial autocorrelation and fuzzy logic model were used to identify spatial groundwater quality patterns based on 12 physicochemical variables collected from 67 groundwater wells[cite: 35]. [cite\_start]The results showed that both the ANN (CV) and ANN (B) models performed better than other optuna-based models during the test phase ($RMSE=0.041$, $MAE=0.026$, $R^2=0.971$, and $CC=0.986$) and ($RMSE=0.041$, $MAE=0.025$, $R^2=0.969$, and $CC=0.975$), respectively[cite: 36]. [cite\_start]$SO_{4}^{2-}$, Cl‚Åª and F‚Åª played an important role in the prediction accuracy[cite: 37]. [cite\_start]These results indicate the efficiency of the ANN model in predicting groundwater quality in coastal areas, which would help regional water managers in real-time monitoring and management of sustainable groundwater resources[cite: 40].
